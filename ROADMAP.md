# Stock Market Backend - Roadmap

## Overview
This repository is responsible for managing the backend API of the Stock Market Analysis System. It handles:
- **Stock Data Retrieval:** Fetching real-time and historical data from APIs (Yahoo Finance, Finnhub, Alpha Vantage).
- **User Authentication:** Managing user registration, login, and authorization.
- **Database Interactions:** Storing and retrieving stock and user data using PostgreSQL.
- **AI Integration:** Connecting to the AI service for stock predictions and sentiment analysis.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Utilizing WebSockets for live data streams.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express or Fastify
- **Language:** JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (using ORM such as Prisma or Sequelize)
- **Real-time Data:** Socket.IO (WebSockets)
- **Authentication:** JWT or OAuth-based systems
- **Deployment:** Docker (with deployment on DigitalOcean, Fly.io, or AWS)

## Milestones

### Milestone: Phase 1 - Backend Setup (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal:** Establish the foundational backend infrastructure.
- [ ] **Initialize Project:** Create a Node.js project using Express/Fastify.
- [ ] **TypeScript Setup:** Configure the project with TypeScript (if desired).
- [ ] **Project Structure:** Organize folders (controllers, routes, models, services).
- [ ] **Database Connection:** Set up PostgreSQL connection (using Prisma/Sequelize).
- [ ] **Dockerization:** Create a Dockerfile for the backend service.
  
**Deadline:** End of Week 2

### Milestone: Phase 2 - API Development (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Develop core API endpoints for stock data retrieval and user management.
- [ ] **Stock Data Endpoint:** Implement an API endpoint to fetch real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance/Finnhub.
- [ ] **Historical Data Endpoint:** Build endpoints for retrieving historical stock data.
- [ ] **User Authentication:** Develop endpoints for user registration, login, and token management.
- [ ] **AI Integration:** Create endpoints to call the AI service for predictions and sentiment analysis.
- [ ] **Real-Time Updates:** Set up WebSocket endpoints using Socket.IO for live data.
  
**Deadline:** End of Week 4

### Milestone: Phase 3 - Performance & Security (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal:** Optimize backend performance and implement robust security measures.
- [ ] **Database & Query Optimization:** Improve query performance and response times.
- [ ] **Caching:** Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data.
- [ ] **Security Measures:** 
  - Implement rate limiting.
  - Sanitize inputs.
  - Enforce HTTPS and secure headers.
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Add authorization layers for different user roles.

## Branching Strategy

To keep development structured and organized, follow this branching model:

1. **Main Branches:**
   - `main`: Contains production-ready code.
   - `develop`: Main development branch where new features merge.

2. **Feature Branches:**
   - Create from `develop` for each new feature.
   - Naming: `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`).

3. **Bugfix Branches:**
   - Create from `develop` for bug fixes.
   - Naming: `bugfix/<bug-description>` (e.g., `bugfix/api-response-time`).

4. **Hotfix Branches:**
   - Create from `main` for urgent production fixes.
   - Naming: `hotfix/<fix-description>` (e.g., `hotfix/fix-login-error`).

5. **Release Branches:**
   - Create from `develop` when preparing for a release.
   - Naming: `release/<version>` (e.g., `release/v1.0`).
   - Merge into `main` after final testing and tag the release, then merge back to `develop`.

### Example Commands
- **Creating a Feature Branch:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/user-authentication develop
